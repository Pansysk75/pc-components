# Web App

This is the backend and frontend of the PC Components web app.

## Instructions: 
- Make sure `Node` and `npm` are installed
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Depending on the API Server used (local or deployed), the `backendUrl` must be set accordingly in the `config.json` file (`http://64.226.122.251:81/` for our deployed api server, `http://localhost:81/` for locally hosted api server). Default option is the deployed server.
- Run `node server.js`

Then navigate to `localhost:80` in your browser.
